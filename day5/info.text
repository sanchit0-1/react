// in this we are learning two way bindings :- here two way bindings are used only in form element only -
1. when you make a form then first you give this data to react and react saves it in it's useState and then
2. whatever is saved in react it is then displayed to form in such a way 
so when these two steps are followed then it is called twe way binding or it also called controlled element.
